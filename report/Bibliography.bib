	Abstract = {A Bloom filter is a space-efficient data structure that	answers set membership queries with some chance of	a false positive. We introduce the problem of designing	generalizations of Bloom filters designed to answer	queries of the form, “Is x close to an element of S?”	where closeness is measured under a suitable metric. Such a data structure would have several natural applications in networking and database applications. We demonstrate how appropriate data structures	can be designed using locality-sensitive hash functions	as a building block, and we specifically analyze the performance of a natural scheme under the Hamming metric.},

@article{NearestNeighborHighDimensions,
	Abstract = {In this article, we give an overview of efficient algorithms for the approximate and exact nearest neighbor problem. The goal is to preprocess a dataset of objects (e.g., images) so that later, given a new query object, one can quickly return the dataset object that is most similar to the query. The problem is of significant interest in a wide variety of areas.},

@proceedings{LSH,
	Abstract = {We show the existence of a Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) family for the angular distance that yields an approximate Near Neighbor Search algorithm with the asymptotically optimal running time exponent. Unlike earlier algorithms with this property (e.g., Spherical LSH [1, 2]), our algorithm is also practical, improving upon the well-studied hyperplane LSH [3] in practice. We also introduce a multiprobe version of this algorithm and conduct an experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data sets. We complement the above positive results with a fine-grained lower bound for the quality of any LSH family for angular distance. Our lower bound implies that the above LSH family exhibits a trade-off between evaluation time and quality that is close to optimal for a natural class of LSH functions.},
