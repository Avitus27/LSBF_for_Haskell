\section{Project Objectives}
This project started as an investigation into hashing, Haskell and how C$\lambda$ash can be used to program an FPGA with Haskell code. During the research phase of this project, it was noted that the student would be required to have knowledge of Hardware Definition Language (HDL) to effectively understand how to program an FPGA. Therefore the specification of this project was adapted.

The objectives of this project are to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item demonstrate how one would set-up the provided FPGA for programming
	\item provide an implementation of a hashing algorithm that would be suited to the FPGA hardware
\end{itemize}

\section{Setting up the FPGA }
The provided FPGA was the DE0 Nano\cite{DE0NanoWebpage}, a compact FPGA suited to education. Resources exist on the manufacturer webpage as well as the provided software on how to set up the device. In the interest of making it
