\lhead{\emph{Introduction}}

This report and implementation of Locality Sensitive Bloom Filter contains several distinct parts:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A recursion based LSBF in Python
	\item A comparison between LSBF and other search methods
	\item Research that was done into implementing the project on an FPGA
	\item A critical analysis of this implementation of LSBF and improvements that can be made in future research
\end{itemize}

The aim of this report is to prove that an efficient implementation of LSBF is possible and to point to the research in the field of hashing algorithms that inspired this investigation. This report also contains recommended reading for future improvements that can be made to the provided implementation of LSBF.
