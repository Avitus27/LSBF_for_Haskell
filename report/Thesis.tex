	A bloom filter is a space efficient probabilistic data structure which can quickly test for set membership.
	
	However, since a standard bloom filter will only test for presence, it has limitations. This project shows the feasibility of Locality Sensitive Bloom Filters (LSBF) for single-dimensional data and points to further, theoretical, algorithms for distance sensitive hashes that can be used efficiently for multidimensional data. This report also contains an approximate calculation of space and time complexity.
	
	This has applications in areas like machine learning and searching where an answer that’s “close enough” may be satisfactory.
